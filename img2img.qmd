title: "Guide: Turn a Sketch Into a Photo"
---

1. Draw a sketch on paper or using software like MS Paint. Make sure the width:height ratio is 1:1. Example:
![](res/tornadoSketch.png)
2. Go to a [Stable Diffusion image to image](https://dezgo.com/image2image){target="_blank"} portal.
<!-- `{target="_blank"}` tells the browser to open link in new tab -->
3. Select your desired model and upload your sketch.
4. Type in your prompt. Example: "Tornado destroying farm house".
5. Click the green *Run* button.

First result:
![](res/tornadoDestroyingFarm1.png)

This looks interesting, but is certainly not a tornado, and there is no farm house in sight. I clicked the *Run* button to generate again:

![](res/tornadoDestroyingFarm2.png)

There is a house now, but no tornado. Getting the output you desire requires a combination of rerunning the generation (each time it is run, a random seed is chosen), trying different sketches, and rewording your prompt.
