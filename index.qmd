# My Setup

I use [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) as my OS and [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) as my window manager. [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) is my preferred keyboard layout; it balances familiarity with Qwerty, ergonomic typing, and still works nicely for programming and typing CLI commands. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) is my primary code editor / IDE.
